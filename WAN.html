        <h1>Wide Area Network (WAN)</h1>
    </div>


    <div class="Outer">
        <p>A wide area network is a telecommunications network that extends over a large geographic area. It is a 
            collection of LANs or other networks that communicate with one another. WAN connections can be wired 
            or wireless, even though they cover a large area. Wireless WANs include 4G/5G and 
            Long-Term Evolution (LTE) networks. At the same time, wired WANs typically include broadband 
            internet services and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), to increase the speed.The internet is 
            the world's biggest WAN.</p>

    <div class="ADV">
        <p>Advantages:</p>

        <ul>
           <li>
            Wide Area Network (WAN) technology allows seamless communication across different nations or continents. It ensures fast message delivery while maintaining security and anonymity.
           </li>

           <li>
            With WAN, you can swiftly download updated files and data from the server, ensuring that all connected devices have access to the latest information. 
           </li>

           <li>
            Business people can sell their items online not only in their city, state, or nation but also in foreign nations using WAN networks.
           </li>

            <li>
                Since WANs have a wider coverage area than other networks, their bandwidth is also higher than other networks.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <div class="DISADV">
        <p>Disadvantages:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                WAN faces more security concerns due to interconnected technologies, potentially inviting malicious attacks and identity theft.
            </li>

            <li>
                Setting up WANs is complex and expensive, requiring routers, switches, and security tools.
            </li>

            <li>
                Some remote areas lack energy supply or proper infrastructure, leading to frequent disconnections. Dedicated ISP lines can mitigate this issue.
            </li>

            <li>
                Identifying network problems in extensive WANs is time-consuming, especially when buried under the ocean. Repairs are resource-intensive.
            </li>

            <li>
                Maintaining a 24/7 data center for WANs is challenging, requiring constant support from network technicians and administrators. 
            </li>
