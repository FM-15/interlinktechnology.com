        <h1>Ring Topology</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="Outer">
        <p> A ring topology is a network design in which devices are linked together in a ring structure and
            communicate with one another based on the nodes that are next to them on the ring. 
            A ring topology is more effective than a bus architecture and can support greater loads. 
            Most Ring Topologies are referred to as one-way unidirectional ring networks since packets may 
            only go in one direction. Different types of ring topology installations function differently 
            depending on the devices that are being connected to build a network. 
            Both local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs) employ ring topologies 
            (wide area networks). A coaxial cable or an RJ-45 network cable is used to connect computers 
            together in a ring topology, depending on each computer's network card type.<p>


            <p>Every device in a ring topology is simply linked together with two other devices in a circular 
            pattern. Data is passed from one device to another in this sort of topology until it reaches its
            goal. Tokens are used to convey data from the transmitting node to the destination. Token ring
            topology is another name for this architecture.<p>

        <p>Advantages:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Ring networks offer fast data transmission speeds, unaffected by excessive load.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Adding workstations one at a time simplifies scaling without overloads or performance declines.
            </li>

            <li>
                Ring topology's one-way flow minimizes data collisions, easing data delivery.
            </li>

            <li>
                Troubleshooting ring faults is straightforward, except for unidirectional issues. Workstations after a faulty computer cease to function, aiding quick fault location.
            </li>

            <li>
                Ring topologies require less cabling than complex alternatives. No central switch reduces equipment costs, appealing to budget-conscious businesses.
            </li>

        </ul>

    <div class="DISADV">
        <p>Disadvantages:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                In a ring topology, data packets pass through all linked workstations, raising security concerns due to potential unauthorized access.
            </li>

            <li>
                Unidirectional paths mean each equipment depends on others; compensating for a single workstation loss is necessary.
            </li>

            <li>
                Adding/removing nodes disrupts network activity; users bear the burden of change-related outages.
            </li>

            <li>
                A single cable supports the entire ring structure; if it fails, signals stop moving.
            </li>

            <li>
                Ring topology severely limits bandwidth; fewer connected nodes are advisable to avoid communication hiccups.
            </li>
        </ul>
