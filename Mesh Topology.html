    </div>

    <div class="Outer">
        <p>A mesh network is a local area network architecture in which the infrastructure nodes (such as bridges, switches, and other infrastructure devices) link directly, dynamically, and non-hierarchically to as many other nodes as they can in order to transport data to and from clients effectively.

            Every node is able to take part in the information relay because of the lack of dependence on a single node. Mesh networks automatically arrange and configure themselves, which can lower the installation burden. In the case that a few nodes fail, the ability to self-configure provides dynamic burden allocation.
            
            All of the computers are interconnected to one another in a sort of networking called mesh topology. The connections between devices in a mesh topology are made at random. Computers, switches, hubs, and other devices can all be linked nodes. Even if one of the links in mesh architecture fails, the other nodes can still be disseminated. Because there is no hierarchy, interdependency, or regular pattern between the nodes in this sort of topology, it is exceedingly costly. The mesh topology's connections are not more straightforward to build.
            
            In a mesh architecture, every computer serves as a relay for other nodes in addition to being responsible for delivering their own signals. Its connections can be wired or wireless and are typically utilized for wireless networks. The mesh topology arrangement includes a point-to-point link between each node. A mesh topology network is seen in the image below.</p>

        <p>Advantages:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Mesh topology lacks hierarchy, allowing direct communication between any connected devices via routing capabilities.
            </li>

            <li>
                Multiple pathways ensure reliability. Each node connects to every other, maintaining consistent data transmission. Even if nodes fail, messages can still be sent.
            </li>

            <li>
                Adding devices doesn't affect data transmission. Nodes remain linked, ensuring uninterrupted information flow.
            </li>

            <li>
                Eliminating the need for additional routers simplifies adjusting network size. Introduce new technology seamlessly in a corporate setting.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <p>Disadvantages:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Mesh topology is costly due to the need for numerous equipment pieces.
            </li>

            <li>
                Initial setup and maintenance take time, although adding nodes later is easier.
            </li>

            <li>
                Managing several networks may lead to redundant connections.
            </li>

            <li>
                Each node handles multiple tasks and serves as a router, increasing workload.
            </li>

            <li>
                Low-power mesh topologies suffer from processing limitations, causing latency problems.
            </li>
        </ul>
