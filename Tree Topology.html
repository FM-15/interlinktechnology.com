    <div class="Outer">
        <p>Tree topology is a hierarchical arrangement where interconnected devices resemble a tree. It 
            features a central node (the root) connected to multiple tiers of child nodes, creating a 
            hierarchical structure. Combining elements of bus and star topologies, tree topology offers 
            flexibility and scalability. Each network node has only one route, making it the simplest 
            topology. Devices at lower levels connect to those higher up, often using point-to-point or 
            point-to-multipoint links. While less popular, tree topology is used for scalability or hierarchical 
            setups between networks. Its structure radiates outward like tree branches from a core node, ensuring 
            a single visible path between any two nodes.</p>

        <p>Advantages:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Tree topology combines features of both bus and star topologies.
            </li>

            <li>
                Each node connects to a hub or concentrator, simplifying error identification and cable repairs.
            </li>

            <li>
                Adding devices is straightforward, making it a favoured solution. Manufacturers can easily maintain network-connected devices.
            </li>

            <li>
                Flaws in one node don't affect others. The backbone cable ensures normal operation even if a node fails.
            </li>

            <li>
                Expansion is easy—add cables and another hub. More star networks can connect to the primary cable or bus.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Disadvantages:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Managing point-to-point connections, individual star networks, and error detection is time-consuming due to the tree’s size.
            </li>

            <li>
                Installing tree topology is difficult and expensive. As the network expands, cable length increases, posing challenges for cable management.
            </li>

            <li>
                All computers in a tree topology are interconnected, compromising security. A hacker accessing one workstation can access all data.
            </li>

            <li>
                The backbone cable is critical; if it fails, the entire network is affected. Damage location determines the extent of disruption.
            </li>
