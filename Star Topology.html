        <p>Star topology, often known as a star network, is one of the most typical network 
            configurations. In this design, each node is linked to a hub, switch, or computer that serves 
            as the hub for the whole network. The main network device serves as a server, and the other network 
            nodes function as clients. Depending on the network card type in each computer, a coaxial or RJ-45 
            network cable is utilized in a star topology configuration.
            
            Each device is connected to a central hub in a network structure called a star topology, 
            sometimes referred to as a star network. Star topology is by far the most popular network 
            topology and one of the most used computer network setups. In star topology network 
            configuration, a star-shaped icon represents every device connected to a central network device.
            
            In contrast to mesh topology, a device in a star topology must use a hub to interact with the 
            other devices; it cannot do so directly. The core network device acts as a server, while the 
            peripheral devices act as clients. The RJ-45 or coaxial cable is utilized in a star topology, 
            depending on the type of network card that has been placed in each machine. Star topology is fairly 
            simple and easy to implement in a computer network, similar to a Bus Topology.
            
            Both receiving and delivering messages from the sender are handled by this central device, 
            which might be a Passive Hub, Active Hub, or Switch. In each situation, the method for operating 
            the central device is different.</p>

        <p>Advantages:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Mistake Tolerance: Only one node is affected by issues, enhancing resilience.
            </li>

            <li>
                Device Variety: Connect diverse devices; ideal for PCs, printers, and more.
            </li>

            <li>
                Scalability: Easily add new devices; maintain production levels.
            </li>

            <li>
                Low Data Collisions: Each node connects directly to the central core.
            </li>

            <li>
                Multiple Strategies: Use active hubs, passive hubs, or switches.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Disadvantages:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                If the central hub or switch malfunctions, the entire network is affected. Replacing the hub is crucial.
            </li>

            <li>
                Star topology requires extensive cabling, making it costly. However, it improves productivity and maintenance efficiency.
            </li>

            <li>
                Wired connections limit movement; users can't easily relocate workstations or print remotely.
            </li>

            <li>
                Wireless star architecture is slow; wired networks handle high traffic better.
            </li>

            <li>
                Cables may suffer damage due to obstacles or external factors, affecting network reliability. Protective measures help prevent issues.
