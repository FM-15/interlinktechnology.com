        <h1>Personal Area Network (PAN)</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="Outer">
        <p>A personal area network (PAN) links electronic devices within the close vicinity of a user. 
            PANs vary in size from a few centimeters to several meters. One of the most prevalent instances 
            of a PAN in the real world is the pairing of a Bluetooth earpiece and a smartphone. In addition 
            to connecting laptops, printers, tablets, mouses, and keyboards, PANs may also connect additional 
            computing devices. PANs transmit data between devices without requiring internet connectivity.</p>

    <div class="ADV">
        <p>Advantages:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                It is cost-effective because it doesn't require expensive installations or cable connections between devices, unlike conventional networks. 
            </li> 

            <li>
                It is more secure than other networks because connecting endpoints require authorization from the authorized user before exchanging data.
            </li>

            <li>
                It is more stable and dependable than larger networks because it operates independently of servers and functions within a limited range. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Devices can simultaneously connect to multiple other devices. For example, a smartphone may connect to several tablets and mobile phones at once.
            </li>

            <li>
                PAN is adaptable and efficient for short ranges. 
            </li>
        </ul>

    <div class="DISADV">
        <p>Disadvantages</p>

        <ul>

            <li>
                PANs are slower than WAN, LAN, and MAN networks due to limited data transfer rates, especially with technologies like Bluetooth.
            </li>

            <li>
                PANs have limited coverage, typically around 10 meters, and support only a restricted number of connected devices.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                PANs, being wireless, emit hazardous radiation like microwave signals, which can adversely affect both humans and animals, leading to issues such as cerebral injury and heart problems. 
            </li>

            <li>
                PANs, relying on infrared signals, can only transmit data in a direct line. Consider a TV remoteâ€”it functions only when pointed directly at the television.
            </li>
        </ul>
