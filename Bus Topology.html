        <h1>Bus Topology</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="Outer">
        <p>In the Bus topology, nodes are connected in a line. Every node on the network can monitor every 
            packet delivered on the cable in a bus topology. Every packet is examined by each node to see 
            if it is meant for that node. If so, the packet is claimed by the node. If not, the packet is 
            ignored by the node. Each computer on the network will then be able to respond to data delivered 
            to it and ignore data sent to other computers.

            If the cable in a bus network breaks, the entire network is disabled. 
            Because data cannot span the distance formed by the break, the nodes on opposite sides of the 
            break can continue to interact with each other. Even nodes on the same side of the break may be 
            unable to interact with one another because the open end of the cable left by the break disrupts 
            the efficient transmission of electrical signals.
            
            The use of a bus topology has various advantages. It's simple to add new devices, replace current 
            devices, or uninstall old devices without impacting other connected devices, compared to other
            network topologies like mesh and star, less cable is used, and the cable can be quickly extended 
            as needed.

        <p>Advantages:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Connects devices linearly along a single backbone cable, suitable for non-technical users.
            </li>

            <li>
                Requires Minimal cabling, only as many cables as nodes, reducing setup costs.
            </li>

            <li>
                Adding/removing devices doesn't affect others, beneficial for small networks.
            </li>

            <li>
                Easily expand by adding devices to existing backbone cable, useful for small to medium-sized networks.
            </li>

            <li>
                Data travels directly along the backbone, making it faster. 
            </li>

        <p>Disadvantages:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Bus topology isn't ideal for large networks; its limitations become more pronounced as the network grows.
            </li>

            <li>
                When the entire network goes down, pinpointing the issue is challenging. Troubleshooting individual devices is also difficult.
            </li>

            <li>
                Terminators prevent signal reflection and ensure integrity; improper termination affects performance.
            </li>

            <li>
                Bus topology experiences high packet loss due to collisions on the shared medium.
            </li>

            <li>
                If the main cable is damaged, the entire network fails or splits. 
            </li>
