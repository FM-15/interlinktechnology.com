        <h1>Local Area Network (LAN)</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="Outer">
        <p>A Local Area Network (LAN) is a collection of computers and other devices that are all connected 
            through a network and are all located in the same premises, such as a house or business. In most 
            cases, the local area network is owned by a single department or unit. It is simple to design, 
            maintain, and grow, and it has a high level of system flexibility. LANs allow devices to share 
            resources like printers and exchange information. Wi-Fi and Ethernet are common technologies 
            for LANs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ADV">
        <p>Advantages:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li>
                On a Local Area Network (LAN), sharing a single licensed program allows any device on the network to use it. 
            </li>
       
            <li>
                LAN-connected devices transfer files and communicate directly using Ethernet cabling. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Company-related information is stored on a central server, allowing clients to seamlessly access it when requested.
            </li>                
                  
            <li>
                LANs provide a secure environment for data protection. Clients can manage and control access to files, ensuring that only approved users can retrieve information.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                LAN allows file locking in its network.
            </li>    
        </ul>

    <div class="DISADV">
        <p>Disadvantages:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Data protection can be compromised if the server is not properly programmed, leading to unauthorized access and frequent glitches.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                If the device, file, or server crashes, it affects the whole network.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Malware can easily penetrate the LAN, corrupt the whole network, and destroys important data.
            </li>
                     
            <li>
                LAN requires frequent maintenance and the involvement of technicians and system operators.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Installing a LAN can be costly due to specialized software for server installation, expensive equipment , and the need for professional operators to manage large office LANs.
            </li>
        </ul>
