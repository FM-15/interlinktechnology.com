        <h1>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)</h1>
    </div>


    <div class="Outer">
        <p>A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a computer network that connects computers within a 
            metropolitan area, which could be a single large city, multiple cities and towns, or any given 
            large area with multiple buildings. A MAN is larger than a local area network (LAN) but smaller 
            than a wide area network (WAN). MANs do not have to be in urban areas; the term "metropolitan" implies 
            the size of the network, not the demographics of the area that it serves.

        <p>Advantages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It can send data in both directions at the same time.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                It is more comprehensive than a LAN and offers greater security than a WAN.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                It improves data handling efficiency while increasing data transfer speed.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                It facilitates the cost-effective sharing of shared resources such as printers.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                It provides an excellent backbone for a vast network, thus increasing WAN access.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <div class="DISADV">
        <p>Disadvantages:</p>

        <ul>           
            <li>
                Compared to LAN, more cable is required to set up a Metropolitan Area Network.
            </li>

            <li>
                These networks must be implemented by skilled technicians and network administrators.
            </li>

            <li>
                This network's implementation and management costs are higher than those of a local area network.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                It is challenging to manage this network because it's an extensive network of numerous local area networks.
            </li>
            
        </ul>
